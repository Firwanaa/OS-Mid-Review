###### 16- Race conditions are possible in many computer systems. Consider an online auction system where the current highest bid for each item must be maintained. A person who wishes to bid on an item calls the bid(amount) function, which compares the amount being bid to the current highest bid. If the amount exceeds the current highest bid, the highest bid is set to the new amount. This is illustrated below:

   void bid(double amount) {

       if (amount > highestBid)

           highestBid = amount;

    }

###### Describe how a race condition is possible in this situation and what might be done to prevent the race condition from occurring.

Here's how a race condition can occur:

1. User A and User B both want to bid on an item.
2. User A's thread checks the current `highestBid` and sees that it's $100.
3. User B's thread also checks the `highestBid` and also sees it's $100.
4. User A's thread sets the `highestBid` to $200 because User A is willing to pay more.
5. User B's thread sets the `highestBid` to $250 because User B is willing to pay more.

In this scenario, User B's bid was not considered even though it was higher than User A's bid due to the race condition. The last update to `highestBid` is the one that sticks, and the system does not correctly represent the actual highest bid.

To prevent the race condition, you can use synchronization mechanisms such as mutexes or locks to make sure that only one thread can access and modify the `highestBid` variable at a time. This ensures that the comparison and update are atomic operations and that bids are processed correctly.

###### 17- To solve the race condition issue in question 16, how you can use semaphore to solve it?

```C
#include <semaphore.h>

//Declare a semaphore to protect the highestBid variable
sem_t bidSemaphore;

// Initialize the semaphore


void bid(double amount) {
sem_init(&bidSemaphore, 0, 1);
    // Wait until the semaphore is available
    sem_wait(&bidSemaphore);

    if (amount > highestBid) {
        highestBid = amount;
    }

    // Release the semaphore
    sem_post(&bidSemaphore);
}
```
